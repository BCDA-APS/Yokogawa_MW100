This module supports the Yokogawa MW100 Digital Acquisition Unit, and
depends on the /M1 math option.  It was written for Linux IOCs, while
others might work as well.

This device uses a network interface to communicate, and has a modular
design to allow the mixing of DAC, ADC, relay, TTL, and other modules.
It is also an industrial device primarily used for monitoring, so its
design is not optimized for high performance operation.  The system is
actually quite complex, as it can: read modbus channels over both
serial and the network, perform calculations on the measurements, set
alarms, do logging, etc.  Some subset of the functionality is
supported, and features have been added as needed. However, there is
no attempt made to utilize the full capability of the device from
EPICS, although the device can be simultaneously controlled by vendor
software or the built-in web server, as it supports multiple
simultaneous and independent connections.

I assume that the support works for all modules, but this has been
tested only with the following: MX110-UNV-M10, MX115-D05-H10,
MX120-VAO-M08, and MX125-MKC-M10.

<h2>Channel descriptions</h2>

The MW100 can handle up to 60 measurement channels, referred to as
channels 001-060.  The math option adds 300 computation channels
(A001-A300), 300 communication input channels (C001-C300), and 60
constant channels (K01-K60).

The module bus can have up to 6 modules on it.  The maximum number
of I/O channels for the MW100 is 60 (referred to as channels 001-060),
with a maximum of 10 channels per modules.  Each module has a
dedicated slice of the 60 channels, with the first module owning
001-010, the second owning 011-020, etc.  The first module is the one
closest to the main module.


<h2>Setting up the unit</h2>

Due to the complexity of the MW100, the configuration of the unit
currently needs to be done through its web interface.  This includes
not only service configuration, but also channel configuration.  The
way the unit works is that there are modes of operation.  Any
configuration needs to be done while in the "Settings" mode and
computations are stopped, while all data acquisition is done in the
"Meaurements" mode and the computations should be started.  The mode
can be toggled from EPICS or through the native web server.  So to do
configuration changes, make sure the unit is in Settings mode and do
the changes through the web server.

Upon getting the unit, get it on your network, as described in the
manual.

Plug your modules into the module bus, realizing that each module
location to the left of the main module oper



<h2>Operation</h2>

Once the unit is configured and running on the network, the EPICS
support in this module will work for reading data while in Measurement
mode and calculations are enabled.

The default way the measurements are done is that there are two
records that trigger reading all of the values on the device, one for
input values (such as ADC and TTL) and another for output values (such
as DAC and relay).  By default, both records use a time value in their
SCAN fields to periodically poll values and put them into a cache, and
the record for these values are set to <b>I/O Intr</b> which allow them to
be updated by an interrupt call.  If a measurement record is decoupled
from the master poll rates by setting their SCAN field to a time
value, the data associated with a record will be retrieved with all
the associated information put into the cache, and the new value will
be returned; however, the associated status, unit, and alarm records
for the measurement will return cached values only.  This means that
to do read an independent channel is to read the measurement value,
then forward link to all the associated records to grab the cached
values from that read.  

The operational status values also have a similar record for
triggering periodic reads.  These values regard the mode the device is
in, as well as if calculaions are enabled.

There are calculations, communication inputs, and constants to be read
by the pollers. The calculations (which need to be defined through the
web interface) allow the transformation of measurements with the
communication input values and predefined constants.  The first 60
calculation channels allow for a long calculation (string length of
120 characters), while the last 240 channels allow for short
calculations (8 or 10 characters, depending on firmware version).

When an error happpens, the error string is displayed, split into
three 40-character string records.  The error can be cleared, which
also clears it from the units LED display.

<h3>Modules</h3>

The analog output modules are only directly controlled by EPICS if
they are put into communication mode ("Comm. Input").  If a channel is
put into the other mode ("Trans"), the value will still be read.

The digital output modules (relays) are typically used in two modes.
One is direct control from EPICS ("Comm. Input"), and the other is for
it to be controlled by an alarm ("Alarm").  The two modes can not be
used at the same time.

The analog input modules have many configuration options, with one of
the most useful is being configured as a thermocouple reader, giving a
result through EPICS as a temperature value and units.

<h2>Records</h2>

There are currently 7 records supported for various purposes: ai, ao,
bi, bo, mbbi, mbbo, and stringout.  When using them, <b>DTYP</b> needs
to be set to "Yokogawa MW100".  For each instrument initialized with
the driver, a handle is associated for use with record device support
in the <b>INP</b> field.
<p>
For record commands that can refer to multiple items or locations,
addressing is used.  Certain commands also need sub-addressing.
<p>
The general format of the <b>INP</b> field is one of the following:
<ul>
  <li>"@handle command"
  <li>"@handle command:address"
  <li>"@handle command:address.sub_address"
</ul>

Here's a summary of the commands:

  <dt><b>VAL</b></dt>
  <dd>Requires address:
    <ul>
      <li>001-060
      <li>A001-A0300
